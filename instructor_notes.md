### Instructor Comments

+ This looks like a very good start Kevin. It looks like you're still working on the services. The model files look blank - am I looking at the wrong branch?
+ Methods look great - nice and small
+ Consider adding some attr_accessor methods to your models and the service objects. Methods like these getters and setters are the interface that provides access to the data in your models - it's how your services can access data on your models, since they can't get access to the @instance_variables.
+ Looking forward to seeing you complete building it out. Nice job.
